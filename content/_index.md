# What's going on here?

**Two members of Crieff had a wee idea - then we made it happen!**
  
We would like to bring a little bit of Crieffmas spirit to the town and
surrounding areas this festive season. We’d love you all to join in and help
make it happen.

There are so many wonderful lights and displays lighting up the streets that we
thought it would be a great idea to show them all off. So we thought we'd try
and create a list of all the festive displays in Crieff, and help people take a
walk through the town to see the work people are putting in.

With so many restrictions this year, why not get out and about during the
Christmas holidays and explore the colour and sparkle of Crieffmas Wanderland?!

# How does it work?

In short, folks tell us they've made a festive display in their house, and we
collate the list and publish it here so that fellow Crieffers can get the list
and take a wander.

# How do I submit my display?

Do you have a Christmas window display or lights? Would you like to show off a
festive picture in your window?

Follow the link below and enter your street details (house number is optional,
it's just so we don't count duplicate submissions). We are regularly updating
[the list](/list) of house displays, so you'll be included soon!

[Submit your display][form]

We have made up a whole host of resource packs that can be used to create your
picture to save you going out to buy anything new. These are FREE for everyone
and can be collected from Crieff ConneXions or Santa’s Post Office on the High
Street.
